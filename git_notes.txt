git push -u origin <branch name> pushes your changes to the github and updates your changes, syncs terminal with github
git commit -m "notes about your changes" , this allows you to make notes about a specific file and what changes you made, so that would be helpful in determaining where you are if you need to look back at code.
git status is pretty cool. It tells you currently where you are and what's going on, super helpful, and you can't use this enough!
